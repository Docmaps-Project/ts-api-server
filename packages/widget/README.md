# Docmaps Widget Spike

This was created from the [lit-element-starter-ts](https://github.com/lit/lit-element-starter-ts)
template, since that gives us a starting point for building web components with lit and typescript.

## Setup
```bash
pnpm install
```

## Running the project

In one terminal, run the build process. This just compiles the TypeScript whenever
you make a change.

```bash
pnpm run build:watch
```

In another terminal, run the dev server. This will serve the project files
```bash
pnpm run serve
```

Now you will be able to see the contents of index.html at http://localhost:8000/
